	<h2><hr/>Education Goals</h2>
	<p>My goals are to expand my education as a whole and learn new information<br/>
	that will let me go into and stand out into the programming and web application<br/>
	fields in whole. I personally would like to impress potential employers and learn<br/>
	as much as possible to become more experienced in what I do.

	<h2><hr/>Employment Goals</h2>
	<p>The employment goals that I have set are to work as a programmer under a large<br/>
	company and to work my way up through said company. I also want to gain as much experience<br/>
	out of the job I acquire. From there I will improve myself at an astonishing rate and become<br/>
	a well desired and sought-after programmer.
