	<h2>Greetings!</h2>
	<p>GREETINGS FELLOW TRAVELER! Thank you for coming to see my webpage.

	<h2>Education Goals</h2>
	<p>My goals are to expand my education as a whole and learn new information
	that will let me go into and stand out into the programming and web application
	fields in whole. I personally would like to impress potential employers and learn
	as much as possible to become more experienced in what I do. One goal that I have
	for my education is that I want to go to college for at least 2 years. Another long term goal is that 
	I want to compete in various competitions and gain titles through out my high school and college career.
	</p>

	<h2>Employment Goals</h2>
	
	<p>The employment goals that I have set are to work as a programmer under a large
	company and to work my way up through said company once I gain the position after 
	college. I also want to gain as much experience out of the job I acquire.  
	From there I will improve myself at an astonishing rateand become a well desired 
	  and sought-afterprogrammer by the time I'm out of college as well.
